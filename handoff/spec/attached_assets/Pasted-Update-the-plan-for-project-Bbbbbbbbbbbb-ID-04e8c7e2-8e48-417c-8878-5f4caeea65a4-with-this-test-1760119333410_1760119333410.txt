## Overview
Build a simple floating shelf perfect for displaying books and decor. Great beginner project that takes about 2-4 hours.

**Skill Level:** beginner
**Estimated Time:** 2-4 hours
**Estimated Cost:** $45-65

## Safety Warnings
- Always wear safety glasses when cutting or drilling
- Use hearing protection with power tools
- Work in a well-ventilated area

## Materials
- Pine board 1x10 x 6ft — 1 piece ($18)
- Wood screws 2.5" — 1 box ($8)
- Wood glue — 1 bottle ($6)
- Sandpaper 120/220 grit — 1 pack ($7)
- Wood stain (optional) — 1 can ($15)
- Wall anchors — 4 pieces ($6)

## Tools
- Drill/driver (rental $25/day if needed)
- Circular saw (rental $35/day if needed)
- Level (you probably have this)
- Measuring tape (you probably have this)
- Pencil (you probably have this)
- Safety glasses (you probably have this)

## Cut List
- Shelf board: 36" × 9.25" × 3/4" ×1
- Support cleat: 34" × 1.5" × 3/4" ×1

## Build Steps

### Step 1: Measure and mark (15 min)
Measure and mark your cutting lines on the pine board. You'll need one 36" piece for the shelf and one 34" piece for the wall cleat.

### Step 2: Cut boards (20 min)
Using the circular saw, carefully cut both pieces. Double-check measurements before cutting.

### Step 3: Sand surfaces (25 min)
Sand all surfaces starting with 120-grit, then finish with 220-grit for a smooth surface.

### Step 4: Apply finish (1-2 hours)
If using stain, apply evenly and let dry completely. Apply 2 coats for best results.

### Step 5: Install wall cleat (15 min)
Find studs and mount the 34" cleat to the wall using level. Use wall anchors where studs aren't available.

### Step 6: Attach shelf (10 min)
Apply wood glue to top of cleat, then position shelf. Secure with screws from underneath.

## Finishing
- Touch up any visible screw holes with wood filler
- Apply final protective coat if desired
- Let cure 24 hours before loading with items
